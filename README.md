# Real-Time-Case-Study-Based-Scenarios-using-PySpark

This repository contains solutions to real-time case study based scenarios originally presented by Thoufiq Mohammad on his YouTube channel. Initially, the scenarios were presented in SQL, but I have solved them using PySpark, a powerful distributed data processing framework for big data analytics.

**Introduction**

In this project, I've translated SQL-based problem statements into PySpark solutions. PySpark provides a scalable and efficient way to process large datasets, making it an ideal choice for big data analytics tasks.

**Steps**

**Step 1: Importing Modules and Packages**

To start, I imported the necessary modules and packages required for working with PySpark. These include SparkSession from pyspark.sql and other relevant packages.

**Step 2: Creating DataFrames**

I created various DataFrames using Spark.read.csv and included various CSV files in Spark. These CSV files contain the datasets required to solve the given problem scenarios.

**Step 3: Solving Scenario-Based Problems**

Using PySpark DataFrame operations, I solved a variety of scenario-based problems presented in the original case studies. These problems ranged from data manipulation, aggregation, filtering, and more.

**Step 4: Cloud Platform Integration (Databricks)**

Additionally, I solved some of the scenarios on a cloud platform, specifically Databricks. Databricks provides a unified analytics platform that simplifies big data and AI tasks. I utilized Databricks for its scalability and ease of use in handling large datasets.

**Step 5: Testing and Evaluation**

I conducted thorough testing of the PySpark solutions to ensure their accuracy and efficiency. This involved running the code on sample datasets as well as larger datasets to validate its performance.

**Step 6: Documentation and Reporting**

Documentation plays a crucial role in ensuring the reproducibility and maintainability of the solutions. I have provided detailed documentation for each scenario, explaining the problem statement, approach, and solution implemented using PySpark.

**Conclusion**

By solving these case study-based scenarios using PySpark, I've demonstrated the power and versatility of PySpark in handling big data analytics tasks. The solutions provided here serve as a reference for those looking to leverage PySpark for similar data analysis projects.
